This project is a web-based Gym Management System developed as a final course project.

The system includes requirement analysis, database design, and an ERD to support efficient data handling. Prompt engineering techniques were used to generate and refine the website management system.

The project was tested using Robot Framework, and all test cases passed successfully, confirming that the system functions as expected.

# How to Run the Project
